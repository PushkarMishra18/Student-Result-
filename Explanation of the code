This project is a simple Student Result Management System developed in Java to demonstrate exception handling and basic object-oriented concepts. The program allows the user to enter a student's roll number, name, and marks for three subjects, which are validated using a custom exception called InvalidMarksException. If any mark is outside the range of 0–100, the program throws an error and safely returns to the main menu, ensuring the application runs smoothly without crashing. Valid student data is stored inside an array of Student objects, and once the details are added, the system displays a “Details updated successfully” message followed by the student’s complete result, including average and pass/fail status. The user can also search for an existing student by roll number to view their stored details. The project uses try-catch blocks to handle invalid input, custom exceptions for domain-specific errors, and a menu-driven interface to make the system easy to use. Overall, this project demonstrates core Java features such as exception handling, custom exceptions, classes, objects, arrays, and interactive console-based programming.
