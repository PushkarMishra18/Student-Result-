This project is a simple Student Result Management System created in Java.
It is designed to demonstrate exception handling and basic object-oriented programming concepts.
The program allows users to enter a student's roll number, name, and marks for three subjects.
Marks are validated using a custom exception named InvalidMarksException.
If marks are not between 0 and 100, the program throws an error and returns to the main menu without crashing.
Valid student information is stored in an array of Student objects.
After adding a student, the system displays a "Details updated successfully" message.
It also shows the student’s complete details including marks, average, and pass/fail status.
Users can search for a student by roll number to retrieve stored information.
The project uses try-catch blocks to handle invalid or unexpected user inputs.
Custom exceptions help manage specific validation-related errors.
The program uses a simple menu-driven interface for smooth navigation.
The project highlights key Java concepts like exception handling, classes, objects, arrays, and console-based programs.
